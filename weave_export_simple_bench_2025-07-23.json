Let's see what the problem says. The function should return the number of distinct characters in a string, regardless of case. So, for example, 'xyzXYZ' has 3 distinct characters because x, y, z in lowercase and uppercase are considered the same.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to handle case insensitivity. Oh right, I can convert the entire string to lowercase (or uppercase) so that all characters are treated the same. Then, I can create a set of those characters, which automatically removes duplicates. The length of that set would be the number of distinct characters.\n\nWait, but the input is a string. So the steps would be: take the input string, convert it to lowercase, then create a set of each character, and return the length of that set.\n\nLet me test with the examples. For 'xyzXYZ', converting to lowercase gives 'xyzxyz'. The set would be {'x', 'y', 'z'}, so length 3. That's correct. For 'Jerry' which is 'J', 'e', 'r', 'r', 'y'\u2014lowercase is 'jerry'. The set is {'j', 'e', 'r', 'y'}, which is 4 elements. That matches the example.\n\nSo the code should be: take the input string, make it lowercase, create a set, then return len(set).\n\nSo the function body would be:\n\nreturn len(set(string.lower()))\n\nWait, but what about if the string is empty? Well, the problem probably expects that to return 0, which that code would handle.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. Let me make sure there's no edge cases I'm missing. Like non-alphabetic characters? But the problem says 'characters' in general, so any character, not just letters. But the example uses letters. But the code handles all characters, converting them to lowercase. So even if there are numbers or symbols, they are treated as is, but in lowercase. Wait, but numbers and symbols don't have cases. However, the code would still convert them to lowercase, but they remain the same. So that's okay.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the body is simply return len(set(string.lower())).\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return an integer. The set's length is an integer. So that's correct.\n\nYes, that should do it.\n</think>\n\nreturn len(set(string.lower()))", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": true, "reason": "exact_match"}}, "model_latency": 165.21028399467468}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 4, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 165275}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d64-7038-ab25-2fb4808ded10", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.860845Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 8, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction sum_product d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

Let's see. The function takes a list of integers and returns a tuple with the sum and product. For an empty list, sum is 0 and product is 1. \n\nFirst, handle the empty list case. If numbers is empty, return (0, 1). \n\nFor non-empty lists, calculate the sum by adding all elements. The product starts at 1 and multiplies each element. \n\nWait, but what if the list has zero? The product would be zero in that case, which is correct. \n\nSo, initialize sum as 0 and product as 1. Then loop through each number in the list. Add each number to sum. Multiply each number into product. \n\nWait, but for the product, if the list is empty, we return 1. So initializing product as 1 makes sense. For example, if the list is [1,2,3], product is 1*1*2*3 = 6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial product is 1, then multiply by each element. So for [1,2,3], product is 1*1*2*3 = 6. But that's correct. Because the product of the list elements is 1*2*3 = 6. So that's right.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nCheck if the list is empty. If yes, return (0,1).\n\nElse, compute sum and product.\n\nWait, but how to check if the list is empty? Well, in Python, if not numbers: ... \n\nSo inside the function:\n\nsum_result = 0\n\nproduct_result = 1\n\nfor num in numbers:\n\n    sum_result += num\n\n    product_result *= num\n\nThen return (sum_result, product_result)\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Then the loop doesn't run, and sum_result is 0, product_result is 1. Which is correct. So no need for a separate check. Because if the list is empty, the loop doesn't execute, and the initial values are 0 and 1. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nsum_result = 0\n\nproduct_result = 1\n\nfor num in numbers:\n\n    sum_result += num\n\n    product_result *= num\n\nreturn (sum_result, product_result)\n\nWait, but what if the list has a zero? Like [0,1,2]. Then the product would be 0. Which is correct. \n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nsum_product([1,2,3,4]) should return (10, 24). Let's see:\n\nsum is 1+2+3+4=10. Product is 1*2*3*4=24. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: sum_product([]) returns (0,1). Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum_product([0,1,2]) returns (3, 0). Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the body of the function is:\n\nsum_result = 0\n\nproduct_result = 1\n\nfor num in numbers:\n\n    sum_result += num\n\n    product_result *= num\n\nreturn (sum_result, product_result)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n</think>\n\n```python\nsum_result = 0\nproduct_result = 1\nfor num in numbers:\n    sum_result += num\n    product_result *= num\nreturn (sum_result, product_result)\n```", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": true, "reason": "ai_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 323.9130141735077}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 504289}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d63-7567-a66d-ae637e7a5569", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.859391Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 7, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction filter_by_substring d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

Wait, but maybe the user wants me to implement it manually instead of using the built-in method? The example given uses 'Hello' and returns 'hELLO', which is exactly what swapcase does. But the problem says to define the function, so maybe it's acceptable to use the built-in method. However, maybe the exercise is to implement it without using swapcase. Hmm, the problem statement doesn't specify, but the example shows that the output is the same as swapcase. So perhaps the easiest way is to use the swapcase method.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the body of the function. So the function can be as simple as returning string.swapcase(). Let me check the example: 'Hello' becomes 'hELLO', which is correct. So that should work. But maybe there's a catch. What about characters that are not letters? The problem says to flip lowercase and uppercase, so non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged. The swapcase method does handle that, so that's good.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't use swapcase, I could iterate through each character, check if it's lowercase or uppercase, and convert accordingly. For example, using islower() and isupper() methods. But that would be more code. But since the problem allows using built-in functions, maybe the simplest solution is to use swapcase.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase\". So the function is straightforward. So the code would be return string.swapcase(). That's all. Let me test with the example: 'Hello' \u2192 'hELLO', which matches the sample. So that's correct.\n\nBut maybe the user expects a manual implementation.

Then ''.join([]) returns an empty string, which matches the first example.\n\nTherefore, the function can be implemented by returning the result of joining all the strings in the input list. The code would be something like return ''.join(strings). But wait, what if the input list contains non-string elements? But according to the function's type hints, the input is a List[str], so all elements are strings. So no need to handle that case.\n\nSo the body of the function is just one line: return ''.join(strings). Let me check the examples again. For the empty list, it returns '', which is correct. For the list ['a', 'b', 'c'], it joins them into 'abc', which matches the example. That should work.\n\nI think that's all. The function is simple and just uses the built-in join method. No edge cases beyond what's already handled by the type hints.

Let's think about how XOR works. XOR is a bitwise operation where each bit is compared. If the bits are different, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0. So for two binary strings of equal length, I need to go through each pair of bits and compute their XOR.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the two input strings are of the same length. But the problem statement says that the inputs consist only of 1s and 0s. Wait, but what if the strings are of different lengths? The example given has '010' and '110', which are both 3 characters long. The problem statement might assume that the inputs are of the same length. But maybe the function should handle cases where they are not? However, the example provided doesn't have that, and the docstring doesn't mention padding, so perhaps the function is intended to work on strings of equal length. So I can assume that the inputs are of the same length. But maybe I should check that, but the problem doesn't mention it, so perhaps it's not required.\n\nSo the steps are: iterate over each pair of characters from a and b, compute XOR for each pair, and build the result string.\n\nHow to compute XOR for each bit? Let's see. For each position i, take a[i] and b[i]. If they are different, the result is '1', else '0'.\n\nSo, for each i in range(len(a)), which is same as len(b), compare the characters.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nresult = []\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    if a[i] != b[i]:\n        result.append('1')\n    else:\n        result.append('0')\nreturn ''.join(result)\n\nWait, but in Python, strings are iterable, so that's straightforward.\n\nBut what about the case where the strings are of different lengths? The problem statement's example uses equal length strings. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention handling different lengths. So perhaps the function is intended to work only on equal-length strings. So the code can assume that the inputs are of the same length. Therefore, the code can proceed as above.\n\nSo the code for the function would be:\n\nInitialize an empty list to collect the result characters. Loop over each index, compare the characters, append '1' or '0' accordingly. Then join the list into a string and return it.\n\nLet me test with the example given. The example is string_xor('010', '110').\n\nIndices 0: 0 vs 1 \u2192 different \u2192 '1'\n\nIndex 1: 1 vs 1 \u2192 same \u2192 '0'\n\nIndex 2: 0 vs 0 \u2192 same \u2192 '0'\n\nSo the result is '100', which matches the example. That works.\n\nSo the code is as described. Now, implement that in Python.\n\nSo the function's body would be:\n\nresult = []\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    if a[i] != b[i]:\n        result.append('1')\n    else:\n        result.append('0')\nreturn ''.join(result)\n\nYes.

Let's see. The function takes a list of strings and a prefix, and returns a new list containing only the strings that start with that prefix.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, strings have the startswith() method. So for each string in the input list, I can check if it starts with the given prefix. If it does, include it in the result list.\n\nSo the steps are: iterate over each string in the input list, check if it starts with the prefix, collect those that do.\n\nHow to do this in code? Well, I can use a list comprehension. For example, [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)].\n\nWait, but what about empty strings? Well, the startswith method handles that. If the prefix is empty, then all strings would start with it, but according to the examples, the function is supposed to filter based on the prefix. Wait, in the first example, the input is an empty list, and the output is empty. In the second example, the prefix is 'a', and the strings that start with 'a' are 'abc' and 'array'.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward. The list comprehension checks each string in the input list and includes it if it starts with the prefix.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function can be written as a single line: return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)].\n\nWait, but what about case sensitivity? The examples don't mention it, so I assume the function is case-sensitive.

Oh right, because when I iterate through the list, if I check if an element has been seen before, I can decide whether to include it.\n\nWait, but if I use a set to track seen elements, but then I need to make sure that only the first occurrence is kept.

That way, the first occurrence is kept, and subsequent duplicates are removed.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list for the result.\n2. Initialize a set to keep track of elements we've already seen.\n3. Iterate over each number in the input list.\n4. For each number, check if it's in the seen set.\n5.

The function should return the prime factors of a given integer in order from smallest to largest, with each factor appearing as many times as it's present in the factorization. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function needs to handle the case where n is 0 or 1. Wait, but the examples given are for numbers like 8, 25, 70. But the problem says the input is an integer. Hmm, but factorizing 0 isn't possible, and 1 has no prime factors. So maybe the function should return an empty list for n=1? Or maybe the input is assumed to be greater than 1. The examples don't cover that, but the problem statement says \"given integer\", so I should handle all cases.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input number should be equal to the product of all factors. So if n is 1, the product of the factors would be 1, which is correct. But the prime factors of 1 are none, so the function should return an empty list. Similarly, if n is 0, maybe it's undefined, but perhaps the function should handle it. But maybe the function is intended to work for n >= 2. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so I need to consider that.\n\nBut looking at the examples, they use numbers greater than 1. Let's proceed under the assumption that n is a positive integer greater than 1. However, I should handle cases where n is 1 or 0 as well.\n\nLet me think about the algorithm. The standard approach for prime factorization is to start dividing the number by the smallest primes until it's reduced to 1.\n\nSo, start with 2. Divide n by 2 as long as it's divisible. Then move to 3, then 5, etc. Each time a divisor is found, add it to the list and divide n by it. Repeat until n becomes 1.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can iterate up to sqrt(n). However, for the purpose of this problem, even a simple approach should work.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nInitialize an empty list to hold the factors.\n\nStart with divisor i = 2.\n\nWhile i * i <= n:\n\n   while n is divisible by i, append i to the list and divide n by i.\n\n   increment i by 1.\n\nAfter that, if n is greater than 1, append it to the list.\n\nWait, but that's the standard trial division method. Let me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFor 8:\n\nStart with i=2. 8 divided by 2 is 4, again divided by 2 is 2, again divided by 2 is 1. So the list becomes [2,2,2]. Then i increments to 3, but since n is now 1, the loop stops. So the result is [2,2,2], which matches the example.\n\nFor 25:\n\ni starts at 2. 25 is not divisible by 2. Then i=3, same. Then i=4, same. i=5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, then again divided by 5 is 1. So list is [5,5]. Correct.\n\nFor 70: 2 divides 70, so append 2, then 70 becomes 35. Next i=2 again, but 35 is not divisible by 2. So i increments to 3, 35 not divisible by 3. i=4, same. i=5, 35 divided by 5 gives 7. Append 5. Now n is 7. Then i increments to 6, then 7. Now i*i is 49, which is larger than 7. So the loop ends. Since n is 7>1, append 7. So the list is [2,5,7], correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after the loop, if n>1, we add it to the list. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when n is a prime number? For example, factorize(7) would return [7], which is correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nInitialize factors as an empty list.\n\ni starts at 2.\n\nWhile i * i <= n:\n\n   while n % i == 0:\n\n       append i to factors\n\n       n = n // i\n\n   i += 1\n\nAfter that, if n > 1, append n to factors.\n\nBut wait, in the loop, after dividing by i as much as possible, then i is increased. But this approach may miss some factors. For example, if after processing i=2, then i increases to 3, but if n is now 4, then i=3 is not a divisor, but then i increases to 4, and the loop continues. However, when i reaches 4, 4*4 is 16, which is larger than 4, so the loop stops. Then, since n is 4>1, it's added to factors. But that's incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, after processing i=2, n would have been divided by 2 until it's 1. So for example, n=4: initial i=2. 4%2=0, append 2, n=2. Again, divide by 2, append 2, n=1. Then i increments to 3, and the loop stops. Then n is 1, so no addition. So the factors are [2,2], which is correct.\n\nWait, but if n is 12: factors are 2,2,3. Let's see:\n\ni starts at 2. 12%2=0 \u2192 append 2, n=6. Again, 6%2=0 \u2192 append 2, n=3. Now, i increments to 3. Now, i*i is 9, which is greater than 3. So loop stops. Then n is 3>1, append 3. So factors are [2,2,3], correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n\n    factors = []\n\n    i = 2\n\n    while i * i <= n:\n\n        while n % i == 0:\n\n            factors.append(i)\n\n            n = n // i\n\n        i += 1\n\n    if n > 1:\n\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    return factors\n\nWait, but what about n=1? Then, the loop doesn't run. i starts at 2, 2*2=4>1. So the loop is skipped. Then, since n is 1, not greater than 1, so factors is empty. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if n is 0? Well, the problem says the input is an integer. But factorizing 0 is undefined. However, the function may not handle that. The examples don't include that. So perhaps the function is intended for n >= 2. But the code as written would handle n=1, returning empty list. For n=0, the code would loop i from 2, but i*i is 4>0. So loop is skipped. Then, n is 0>1? No. So factors remains empty. So factorize(0) returns empty list, which is incorrect. However, the problem statement may not require handling that. The examples given are for n >=2. So the code may be acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says the input number should be equal to the product of all factors. For example, if n=0, the product would be 0. But factorize(0) returns empty list, product is 1 (empty product). Which is not equal to 0. So that's a problem. However, the problem may not require handling n=0. Since the examples don't include it, perhaps the function is intended to work for n >=2.\n\nBut the user's code has the function signature with n: int. So perhaps the function should handle all integers. But how?\n\nWell, the problem says that the input number should be equal to the product of all factors. So for n=0, the product of factors would be 0. But the function would return empty list, product is 1. So that's invalid. Therefore, perhaps the function should handle n=0 by returning [0], but that's not a prime factorization. However, prime factorization is only defined for integers greater than 1. So perhaps the function is intended to work for n >=2, and for other cases, it may return empty list or raise an error. However, the problem's examples do not include such cases, so the code may proceed as before.\n\nBut the user's code may not handle n=1 or 0. However, the problem's examples show that for n=8, 25, 70, the code works. So the code as written is correct for those cases.\n\nSo the code as written would work. Let me check the sample cases.\n\nSample 1: factorize(8) \u2192 [2,2,2]. Let's simulate.\n\nn=8, factors starts empty. i=2. 2*2=4 \u22648.\n\nn%2 is 0. append 2, n=4.\n\nAgain, n%2=0. append 2, n=2.\n\nAgain, n%2=0. append 2, n=1.\n\nNow, i increments to 3. 3*", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": false, "reason": "not_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 353.3416304588318}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 468748}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d71-705a-bd32-e5a2ef57c728", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.873199Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 19, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction sort_numbers d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

The user wants me to implement the truncate_number function. The goal is to return the decimal part of a positive floating point number. The example given is truncate_number(3.5) returns 0.5. \n\nHmm, so the function needs to decompose the number into its integer part and the decimal part. The integer part is the largest integer smaller than the given number. Wait, that's the floor of the number, right? But wait, for positive numbers, the integer part is just the integer part, but for negative numbers, floor would be different. However, the problem says it's a positive floating point number. So I don't have to worry about negatives.\n\nSo, the approach would be to subtract the integer part from the original number. For example, 3.5's integer part is 3, subtract that from 3.5 to get 0.5.\n\nHow do I get the integer part in Python? Well, one way is to cast the number to an integer. But wait, if the number is like 3.999, casting to int would give 3, which is correct. But what about numbers that are exactly integers, like 5.0? Then the decimal part would be 0.0. But according to the problem statement, the input is a positive floating point number, but maybe it's possible that the decimal part is zero. However, the problem says \"decomposed into an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals (leftover part always smaller than 1)\". So even if the number is an integer, like 5.0, the decimal part is 0.0.\n\nSo for example, truncate_number(5.0) should return 0.0.\n\nSo the method is to take the number, subtract its integer part. But how to get the integer part. For positive numbers, using int(number) would work. Because for 3.5, int(3.5) is 3. For 5.0, it's 5. So subtracting that from the original number gives the decimal part.\n\nWait, but what about numbers like 2.9999999999? The integer part is 2, decimal is 0.9999999999. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be: return number - int(number).\n\nBut wait, what about when the number is something like 3.0? Then the decimal part is 0.0, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the input is negative? The problem says it's a positive floating point number. So we don't need to handle that case.\n\nSo the function is straightforward. Let me test the example given. For 3.5, int(3.5) is 3. 3.5 - 3 = 0.5.

Well, the function's parameter is a float, so that's handled.\n\nSo the body of the function is just return number - int(number).\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the number is very close to an integer but due to floating point precision? For example, 2.9999999999999999 might be represented as 3.0. But in that case, the function would return 0.0, which is correct because the integer part is 2, but the actual value is 3.0. Hmm, but that's a problem with floating point precision. However, the function is supposed to take a positive floating point number.

For example, for 15, the divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The largest proper one is 5.\n\nOne straightforward way is to check all numbers from n-1 down to 1 and return the first one that divides n. However, this might be inefficient for large n. But given that the examples are small, maybe it's acceptable unless the user specifies efficiency.\n\nWait, but for large numbers, this approach could be slow. Let's think of a better method. The largest proper divisor of n is n divided by its smallest prime factor. For example, if n is 15, the smallest prime factor is 3, so 15/3=5. But if n is a prime number, then the largest proper divisor is 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate from 1 to sqrt(n) and check for divisors. For each divisor d found, the corresponding pair is n/d. The largest divisor would be the maximum between the pairs. For instance, for 15, the sqrt is about 3.87. Checking up to 3, we find 3 divides 15. Then the pair is 5. So the maximum is 5.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Initialize the maximum divisor as 1 (since 1 is a divisor of every number).\n2. Iterate from 2 up to sqrt(n). For each i, if i divides n, then check if n//i is equal to n (which can't be, since i is at least 2 and n is at least 2). Wait, no. Wait, for example, if n is 4, then i=2, n//i=2, which is a proper divisor. So, for each i that divides n, the corresponding pair is n//i. We can collect all such pairs and take the maximum.\n\nWait, but if we iterate up to sqrt(n), then for each i that divides n, the other divisor is n/i. So for example, if i is a divisor, then n/i is also a divisor. So the maximum divisor would be the maximum between all the n/i where i is a divisor up to sqrt(n), and the maximum of those. So for example, in 15, the sqrt is ~3.87. So check up to 3. For i=3, 15%3==0, so the other divisor is 5. So 5 is a candidate. So the maximum is 5.\n\nSo the approach would be to iterate from 1 to sqrt(n), check if i divides n. If yes, then add i and n//i to a list of divisors. Then, after collecting all divisors, filter out those equal to n, and take the maximum.\n\nBut since we're looking for the largest proper divisor, we can optimize by checking from the largest possible down. Let's think again. The largest proper divisor is n divided by its smallest prime factor. So if we can find the smallest prime factor, then divide n by it. But how to find the smallest prime factor?\n\nAlternatively, start from n//2 down to 1 and check if it divides n. The first one that does is the answer. For example, for 15, check 7 (15%7 is 1), 6 (15%6=3), 5 (15%5=0). So return 5. This method is O(n) in the worst case, but for numbers with large divisors, it's faster. However, for large n, this is not efficient. But for the sake of simplicity, maybe this is acceptable unless the problem requires efficiency.\n\nBut for numbers like 10000000000000000000000000000000, this approach would be very slow. However, given that the problem's examples are small, perhaps the user expects the straightforward approach.\n\nSo, for the function, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nStart from n-1 and go down to 1, return the first number that divides n.\n\nBut for n=1, there is no proper divisor. But according to the problem statement, the function returns an int, but the example uses 15. Wait, the problem says \"smaller than n\". So for n=1, there are no proper divisors, but the function would have to return something. However, the problem may assume that n is greater than 1. Let's check the example given: 15 returns 5. So for n=1, perhaps the function would return 0 or raise an error. However, the problem's examples don't cover that. But the function is supposed to return an int, so perhaps it's safe to assume that n is greater than 1. However, in code, we need to handle cases where n is 1. But according to the problem's example, maybe the function is intended for n>1.\n\nBut the problem says the function should return the largest number that divides n evenly and is smaller than n. For n=1, there is no such number. So perhaps the function should return 0 or raise an error. But the problem's examples don't show that. So maybe we can assume n is at least 2. However, the function's code must handle all cases.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the example is for 15, which is correct. So perhaps the code can be written as:\n\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return i\n    return 0  # or raise an error for n=1\n\nBut for n=1, this returns 0. However, according to the problem's example, the function returns 5 for 15, which is correct. But for n=1, there is no proper divisor, so returning 0 would be a possible approach.\n\nBut perhaps the problem assumes that n is greater than 1. However, the code must handle all possible n.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate from 1 to sqrt(n), collect all divisors, then take the maximum of those that are less than n.\n\nLet's think of code:\n\nInitialize max_div = 1\n\nfor i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n\n    if n % i == 0:\n\n        max_div = max(max_div, i, n//i)\n\nreturn max_div if max_div != n else 1\n\nWait, but n//i could be equal to n if i is 1, but since we start from 2, that's not possible. Wait, for example, if n=4, and i=2, n//i is 2, which is less than 4. So the code would collect 2 as a divisor. The maximum would be 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut for n=15, the loop would check up to 3 (sqrt(15) is ~3.87). So i=2: 15%2 is 1, no. i=3: 15%3 is 0. Then the max_div is max(1,3,5) =5. So returns 5. Correct.\n\nBut what if n is a prime number? For example, n=7. The loop would check up to 2. For i=2, 7%2 is 1. So max_div remains 1. So the function returns 1, which is correct.\n\nBut for n=4, the code returns 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, the largest proper divisor is 1. The code would check i from 2 to 1. The loop doesn't run, so returns 1. Correct.\n\nWait, the code for the loop is range(2, int(n**0.5) +1). For n=2, sqrt(2) is ~1.41, so int(1.41) is 1. So the range is from 2 to 1+1=2. So the range is 2 to 2, which is empty. So the loop doesn't run, and returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    max_div = 1\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            max_div = max(max_div, i, n//i)\n    return max_div if max_div != n else 1\n\nWait, but when would max_div be equal to n? For example, if n is 4, and i=2, then n//i is 2, which is less than 4. So the max_div is 2, which is correct. So the 'if max_div !=n' part is redundant. So the code can just return max_div.\n\nWait, but for n=1, the code would have max_div=1, which is not a proper divisor. But the function is supposed to return the largest number smaller than n. So for n=1, there is no such number. But the code would return 1. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo the code must handle n=", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": false, "reason": "not_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 348.77412700653076}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 458259}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d5d-7aeb-b9ba-93fce9484c5d", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.853245Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 3, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction below_zero d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

Let's see what the problem says. The function takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations. The account starts with zero balance. I have to check if at any point the balance drops below zero. If it does, return True; otherwise, False.\n\nSo the approach is to track the balance as we process each operation. Start at zero. For each operation in the list, add it to the balance. After each addition, check if the balance is less than zero. If yes, return True immediately. If after processing all operations the balance never went below zero, return False.\n\nWait, but the function is called below_zero, so the return is True if the balance falls below zero at any point.

Never below zero, so return False. The second example: [1, 2, -4, 5]. The balance steps: 1, 3, -1 (here it's below zero, so return True).

The problem says the account starts with zero. So the first operation is applied to zero. For example, if the first operation is -5, then balance becomes -5, which is below zero, so return True.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the example [1, 2, -4, 5]:\n\nbalance starts at 0.\n\nAdd 1: balance 1. Not below zero.\n\nAdd 2: 3. Still okay.\n\nAdd -4: 3-4= -1. Now below zero. Return True.\n\nSo the function returns True as expected.\n\nAnother test case: [-1]. Then balance is -1, return True.\n\nAnother test case: [0, -1]. Balance after first operation is 0, then 0-1 = -1. Return True.\n\nAnother test case: [2, -1, -1]. Balance steps: 2, 1, 0. Never below zero. So return False.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nbalance = 0\n\nfor op in operations:\n\n    balance += op\n\n    if balance < 0:\n\n        return True\n\nreturn False\n\nThat's the code.

Let me think about how to approach this. The function should check if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. \n\nFirst, the input is a list of floats and a threshold. The output is a boolean. So, the plan is to compare every pair of numbers in the list and see if their absolute difference is less than the threshold. If at least one such pair exists, return True; otherwise, False.\n\nWait, but comparing every pair might be inefficient for large lists. However, the problem doesn't mention efficiency constraints, so perhaps a straightforward approach is acceptable here.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible pairs of elements in the numbers list.\n2. For each pair, calculate the absolute difference.\n3. If any difference is less than the threshold, return True immediately.\n4. If after checking all pairs none are found, return False.\n\nBut how to generate all pairs? Using nested loops: for each i in range(len(numbers)), for each j in range(i+1, len(numbers)), compare numbers[i] and numbers[j]. That way, each pair is checked once.\n\nWait, but in Python, using itertools.combinations could be more efficient, but again, for the sake of simplicity, nested loops might be better here.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Loop through each element with i from 0 to len(numbers)-1:\n   - Loop through j from i+1 to len(numbers)-1:\n      - compute abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])\n      - if this value < threshold: return True\n- After all pairs are checked, return False.\n\nYes, that should work. Let me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], threshold 0.5. The differences are 1.0, 2.0, 1.0. All are >=0.5, so return False. Correct.\n\nSecond example: [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], threshold 0.3. Let's see. The pair 2.8 and 3.0 have a difference of 0.2, which is less than 0.3. Also, 2.0 and 2.8? 0.8, no. But 2.8 and 3.0 is the pair. So the function should return True. Correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the nested loops.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty or has only one element? Well, the problem probably assumes that the list has at least two elements. But in code, if the list has less than two elements, the loops won't run, and return False. Which is correct since there are no pairs.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):\n        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:\n            return True\nreturn False\n\nYes. That's the core of the function.\n\nNow, the user wants only the body of the function, not the def line or docstring.

I need to write a Python function called separate_paren_groups that takes a string and splits it into separate balanced parentheses groups. The input might have spaces, which I need to ignore. The example given is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' which becomes ['()', '(())', '(()())'].\n\nFirst, I should think about how to process the string. The main challenge is to correctly identify each group of balanced parentheses, making sure that they are not nested within each other. Also, spaces need to be ignored, so I should probably start by removing all spaces from the input string.\n\nSo, the first step is to remove all spaces. Then, I need to iterate through the string, tracking the balance of parentheses. Each time I encounter an open parenthesis '(', I increment a counter, and for each close ')', I decrement it. When the balance returns to zero, that indicates the end of a group.\n\nWait, but the groups are not nested, so each group is a separate balanced sequence. So, the idea is to collect the characters between the start and end of each group, making sure that the balance is properly tracked.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Remove all spaces from the input string.\n2. Initialize a list to hold the result.\n3. Initialize a variable to track the current balance (starting at 0).\n4. Initialize a temporary string to build the current group.\n5. Iterate through each character in the processed string:\n   a. If the character is '(', add it to the temp string and increment balance.\n   b. If it's ')', add it to the temp string and decrement balance.\n   c. When balance is zero after decrementing, add the temp string to the result list, and reset temp string.\n6. Return the result list.\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' which after removing spaces becomes '(()(()())'. Let me check that. Wait, the original input is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))'. Removing spaces would make it '(()(()())'. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input: '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' \u2192 removing spaces: '(()(()())'.\n\nWait, the first group is '()' which is the first two characters. Then the next group is '(( ))' which becomes '(()())' after removing spaces. Wait, no, the original input is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))', so removing spaces would be '(()(()())'. Wait, let's break it down:\n\nOriginal string:\n\n'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\n- First group: '( )' \u2192 becomes '()' after removing spaces.\n- Second group: '(( ))' \u2192 becomes '(())' after removing spaces.\n- Third group: '(( )( ))' \u2192 becomes '(()())' after removing spaces.\n\nBut when all spaces are removed, the entire string becomes '(()(()())'.\n\nWait, the entire string after removing spaces would be '(()(()())'. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input: '( ) (( )) (( )( ))'\n\nEach space is removed, so:\n\nOriginal: ( ) (( )) (( )( )) \u2192 becomes ( ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ( ) ) ) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the original string as:\n\nThe first part is '( )', which becomes '()'.\n\nThen '(( ))' becomes '(())'.\n\nThen '(( )( ))' becomes '(()())'.\n\nSo when all spaces are removed, the entire string is '() (()) (()())', but without the spaces, it's '()(()())'.\n\nWait, no, the original input is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' \u2192 removing all spaces would make it '(()(()())'.\n\nWait, maybe I should process the entire string by first removing all spaces. So, the first step is to process the input string by replacing all spaces with empty string. Then, the string becomes a sequence of parentheses without any spaces.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to parse this string into groups. Each group is a balanced sequence. So, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize balance to 0, current group as empty string. Iterate through each character:\n\nFor each character:\n\n- if '(', add to current, balance +=1\n- if ')', add to current, balance -=1\n- if balance becomes zero after decrementing, then add current to result, reset current to empty.\n\nSo for example, in the processed string '(()(()())', let's see:\n\nLet's take the example input after removing spaces: '(()(()())'.\n\nWait, maybe I should take the example given. The input is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' \u2192 after removing spaces, it's '(()(()())'. Wait, no, maybe:\n\nOriginal input is '( ) (( )) (( )( ))' \u2192 when spaces are removed, it's '(()(()())'.\n\nLet me check:\n\nOriginal input is:\n\n'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'\n\nBreaking into individual characters (without spaces):\n\n'(' ')' '(' '(' ')' ')' '(' '(' ')' '(' ')' ')'\n\nWait, no. Let me write the original string without spaces:\n\nThe original string is:\n\n'( ) (( )) (( )( ))' \u2192 when you remove all spaces, it's '(()(()())'.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n'( )' \u2192 '()' \u2192 then '(( ))' \u2192 '(())', then '(( )( ))' \u2192 '(()())'.\n\nSo the entire string without spaces would be '() (()) (()())' \u2192 but with no spaces, it's '()(())(()())'.\n\nAh, right! So the entire string becomes '()(())(()())'.\n\nSo, when processing this string, the first group is '()' (balance goes to 1, then 0), then the next is '(())' (balance goes 1, 2, 1, 0), then '(()())' (balance 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0).\n\nSo the algorithm would split the string into these three groups.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nFirst, process the input string by removing all spaces. So, paren_string.replace(' ', '').\n\nThen, iterate through each character, tracking balance and current group.\n\nInitialize balance = 0, current = '', result = [].\n\nFor each char in the processed string:\n\nif char is '(', add to current, balance +=1\n\nelif char is ')', add to current, balance -=1\n\nthen, check if balance is zero. If so, append current to result, reset current to empty.\n\nBut wait, after adding the ')', balance is decremented, and then check if it's zero. So, for example, when the first group is '()' \u2192 after adding the ')', balance is 0, so we add to the result.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nprocessed = paren_string.replace(' ', '')\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent = ''\n\nbalance = 0\n\nfor char in processed:\n\n    if char == '(':\n\n        current += char\n\n        balance +=1\n\n    elif char == ')':\n\n        current += char\n\n        balance -=1\n\n        if balance == 0:\n\n            result.append(current)\n\n            current = ''\n\nSo, after this loop, the result list will have all the groups.\n\nBut wait, what if the input is invalid? For example, unbalanced parentheses. But according to the problem statement, the input is such that groups are balanced. So, the function can assume that the input is valid.\n\nBut in practice, the code may need to handle that, but the problem says that the input groups are balanced, so we can proceed.\n\nTesting the example: processed string is '()(())(()())'.\n\nLoop:\n\nFirst character '(', current = '(', balance 1.\n\nSecond ')', current becomes '()', balance 0. Add to result, current reset.\n\nThird '(', current '(', balance 1.\n\nFourth '(', current '((', balance 2.\n\nFifth ')', current '(()', balance 1.\n\nSixth ')', current '(())', balance 0. Add to result.\n\nThen current is reset.\n\nNext '(', current '(', balance 1.\n\nThen '(', current '((', balance 2.\n\nThen ')', current '(()', balance 1.\n\nThen '(', current '(()(', balance 2.\n\nThen ')', current '(()())', balance 1.\n\nThen ')', current '(()())', balance 0. Add to result.\n\nSo the result is ['()', '(())', '(()())'] which matches the example.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code inside the function would be:\n\nprocessed = paren_string.replace(' ', '')\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent = ''\n\nbalance = 0\n\nfor char in processed:\n\n    if char == '(':\n\n        current += char\n\n        balance += 1\n\n    elif char == ')':\n\n        current += char\n\n        balance -= 1\n\n        if balance == 0:\n\n            result.append(current)\n\n            current = ''\n\nreturn result\n\nBut wait, what if the input is empty or has other characters? According to the problem, the input is a string with groups of parentheses. So, the code should handle only parentheses, but the problem says to ignore spaces, so other characters may not be present. But the problem says that the input is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. So the code can assume that the input is valid.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, in the function's body, we need to write this code.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nprocessed = paren_string.replace(' ', '')\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent = ''\n\nbalance = 0\n\nfor char in processed:\n\n    if char == '(':\n\n        current += char\n\n        balance += 1\n\n    elif char == ')':\n\n        current += char\n\n        balance -= 1\n\n        if balance == 0:\n\n            result.append(current)\n\n            current = ''\n\nreturn result\n\nYes. That's the code.

Let's see what the problem says. The function takes a list of integers and returns a list where each element is the maximum value up to that point in the original list. For example, given [1,2,3,2,3,4,2], the output is [1,2,3,3,3,4,4]. \n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is iterate through the input list, keeping track of the current maximum. For each element in the list, I compare it to the current maximum. If it's larger, the current maximum becomes this element. Otherwise, the current maximum stays the same. Then, I add this current maximum to the result list.\n\nLet me think about the steps. Initialize a result list. Initialize a variable to hold the current maximum, maybe start with negative infinity or the first element. Wait, if the input list is empty, but according to the example, the input is a list of integers. The problem says \"given list of integers\", so maybe the input is not empty. But I should handle empty lists? However, the example given has elements, and the function is supposed to return a list of the same length as the input. So, for each element in numbers, we process it.\n\nLet me start with the first element. The initial current max is numbers[0], and the result list starts with that. Then for each subsequent element, compare to current max. If it's bigger, update current max and append to result. Otherwise, append current max again.\n\nWait, the example: [1,2,3,2,3,4,2]. The output starts with 1, then 2 (max of 1 and 2), then 3 (max of 1,2,3), then 3 (max of previous 3 and 2), then 3 again (since next element is 3, same as current max), then 4, then 4 again.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's code that.\n\nInitialize a result list. If the input is empty, return empty. But the problem's example has elements, so maybe we can assume the input is non-empty. But to be safe, perhaps handle empty lists.\n\nBut the function's signature says numbers is a List[int], but the example uses a non-empty list. So, in the code, perhaps start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, return an empty list. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n- Initialize result as an empty list.\n- Initialize current_max to negative infinity.\n- Iterate through each number in numbers:\n   - if number is greater than current_max, update current_max to number.\n   - append current_max to result.\n- Return result.\n\nWait, but for the first element, current_max starts as -infinity, so first number will be greater, and current_max becomes that number. Then append it. Then for the next elements, compare and so on.\n\nYes, that should work. Let's test with the example:\n\nInput: [1,2,3,2,3,4,2]\n\nFirst iteration: number=1, current_max is -inf, so update to 1, result is [1].\n\nSecond: number=2>1 \u2192 current_max=2, result [1,2].\n\nThird: 3>2 \u2192 current_max=3, result [1,2,3].\n\nFourth: 2 <3 \u2192 append 3 \u2192 result [1,2,3,3].\n\nFifth: 3 is equal to current_max, append 3 \u2192 [1,2,3,3,3].\n\nSixth: 4>3 \u2192 current_max=4, append \u2192 [1,2,3,3,3,4].\n\nSeventh: 2 <4 \u2192 append 4 \u2192 [1,2,3,3,3,4,4]. Which matches the example.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, code this in Python.\n\nBut the function is supposed to return a list of integers. So, in code:\n\nInitialize result as an empty list. current_max = -infinity.\n\nThen loop through each number in numbers:\n\nfor number in numbers:\n\n   if number > current_max:\n\n       current_max = number\n\n   result.append(current_max)\n\nWait, but in Python, we can use float('-inf').\n\nSo, code:\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent_max = float('-inf')\n\nfor number in numbers:\n\n    if number > current_max:\n\n        current_max = number\n\n    result.append(current_max)\n\nreturn result\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, the function's example shows that the input is a list of integers, but the function's signature allows for an empty list. However, according to the problem statement, the function should return a list of the same length as the input. So if the input is empty, the output is empty. The code above would handle that, since for an empty list, the loop doesn't run, and result is empty.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nresult = []\n\ncurrent_max = float('-inf')\n\nfor number in numbers:\n\n    if number > current_max:\n\n        current_max = number\n\n    result.append(current_max)\n\nreturn result\n\nBut wait, for the first element, current_max starts as -inf, so the first number will be greater than current_max, so current_max becomes that number. Then append. So the first element of the result is the first element of the input. Which is correct.\n\nYes. That should work.\n\nSo the code for the function's body is:\n\nresult = []\ncurrent_max = float('-inf')\nfor number in numbers:\n    if number > current_max:\n        current_max = number\n    result.append(current_max)\nreturn result\n\nWait, but the function's parameters are numbers: List[int]. So numbers is a list of integers. So the code is okay.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, check the example again.

The function takes a list of any Python values and returns a list of integers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function needs to iterate over each element in the input list. For each element, I have to check if it's an integer. But wait, in Python, there's int and also bool, which is a subclass of int. However, in the examples given, the test case includes 3.14 (a float) and the output is 5 (int). So the function should return elements that are instances of int, not bool. So I need to check if the type is exactly int, not a subclass.\n\nWait, but in Python, isinstance(True, int) returns True because bool is a subclass of int. But in the examples, for instance, if the input is [True, False], should they be included? The problem says \"only for integers\". But the user's examples don't cover this. However, the examples given in the docstring show that 5 is included, which is an int, and 3.14 is excluded because it's a float. So perhaps the function should check if the value is an instance of int, but not bool. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers that integers are only those that are instances of int, and not bool. So the check should be type(value) is int. Because isinstance(True, int) is True, but type(True) is bool, not int. So using type(value) is int would exclude booleans.\n\nBut wait, the problem's examples don't include booleans. So maybe the user expects that any element that is an integer (including instances of int, but not bool) should be included. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn the first example, ['a', 3.14, 5], the output is [5]. 5 is an int, 3.14 is a float, 'a' is a string. So the function is correctly filtering out non-integers.\n\nIn the second example, [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []], the output is [1,2,3]. So the function includes integers, and excludes other types.\n\nSo for the filtering, the function needs to check if each element is an instance of int. However, if the element is a boolean, like True or False, which are instances of int, but they are not considered integers here? Or are they?\n\nBut the problem's description says \"only for integers\". So perhaps booleans should not be considered as integers. But how to handle that?\n\nHmm. For example, if the input is [True, 5], should the output be [5] or [True, 5]?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the problem expects that the function checks for the type being exactly int, not any subclass. Therefore, using type(value) is int would be the right approach.\n\nBut in Python, the standard way to check if something is an integer is to use isinstance(value, int). But that would include booleans. So maybe the problem expects to include booleans as integers? But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the examples again: in the first example, the input is [ 'a', 3.14, 5 ] and output is [5]. 5 is an int, and 3.14 is a float. So the function is filtering out non-integers. So if the input had a boolean, say True, would that be considered an integer? The problem says \"integers\", but in Python, booleans are not considered integers. However, isinstance(True, int) returns True. So perhaps the function should check for the exact type, not using isinstance.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, if a value is an instance of int, but not a subclass. So, using type(value) is int.\n\nSo, the function should check if the type of the element is exactly int, not any subclass. Therefore, in the code, for each element in values, we check if type(element) is int.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nreturn [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int) and not isinstance(x, bool)]\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the element is a boolean, then isinstance(x, int) is True, but we want to exclude them. So we need to check that the type is int, but not bool.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the type is int, but not a subclass. So:\n\nif type(x) is int.\n\nBecause for booleans, type(True) is bool, not int. So that would exclude booleans.\n\nYes. So the correct way is to check if the type of the element is exactly int. So in code:\n\nreturn [x for x in values if type(x) is int]\n\nBut wait, what about subclasses of int? For example, if someone defines a class MyInt(int), then type(MyInt()) is MyInt, which is a subclass of int. However, the problem's examples don't consider that, and the user's test cases probably expect that only elements of type int are included, not subclasses.\n\nSo the function should filter out any element that is not of type int.\n\nTherefore, the code would be:\n\nreturn [x for x in values if type(x) is int]\n\nBut wait, in Python, for example, if you have a subclass of int, like:\n\nclass MyInt(int):\n    pass\n\nx = MyInt()\n\ntype(x) is MyInt, not int. So the code would not include it. But if the user's intention is to include any instance of int (including subclasses), then the code would use isinstance(x, int).\n\nBut the problem's examples do not include such cases. However, the user's examples show that in the first test case, 5 is included, which is an int. The second test case includes 1,2,3 which are ints. So the function's examples don't cover booleans or subclasses.\n\nBut the problem says \"filter given list of any python values only for integers\". So maybe the function should include any instance of int, including subclasses. However, booleans are a problem because they are a subclass of int.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to check if the element is an instance of int, but not a boolean. Because booleans are considered as integers in Python, but in practice, they are not treated as integers in most contexts.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, the user may not have considered that, and the function is supposed to filter out any elements that are not of type int. So the code should check for type(x) is int.\n\nBut how to test that?\n\nIn the first example, ['a', 3.14, 5], the 5 is of type int, so it's included. The other elements are not. So that's correct.\n\nIn the second example, the elements 1,2,3 are of type int. The other elements are not. So the code would include them.\n\nBut what about if the input has True or False? For example, [True, 5]. The code would not include True, because type(True) is bool. So the output would be [5], which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nreturn [x for x in values if type(x) is int]\n\nSo the function is filtering out any elements that are not of type int, which includes booleans, floats, strings, etc.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the type of 5 is int, so that's correct. So the code would work as expected.\n\nSo the code for the function is a list comprehension that includes each element x in values where type(x) is int.\n\nSo the body of the function is:\n\nreturn [x for x in values if type(x) is int]\n\nBut let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example: ['a', 3.14, 5]. The 5 is int, so it's included. The others are not. Output [5], which matches the example.\n\nSecond example: [1,2,3, 'abc', {}, []]. The 1,2,3 are int, others are not. Output [1,2,3], which matches the example.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the correct code is to use type(x) is int in the list comprehension.\n\nSo the function's body is as follows.\n</think>\n\nreturn [x for x in values if type(x) is int]", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": false, "reason": "not_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 246.1014540195465}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 460311}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d70-7108-95a0-bb92b9adf5ae", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.872024Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 18, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction how_many_times d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

The function should count how many times a substring appears in a string, including overlapping cases. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the examples given: for 'aaa' and 'a', it returns 3, which makes sense. For 'aaaa' and 'aa', it returns 3 because the overlapping cases are counted. So, the standard string methods like count() won't work here because they don't count overlapping occurrences.\n\nSo, I need a way to check each possible position in the string where the substring could start. For example, in 'aaaa' with 'aa', the substrings start at positions 0, 1, 2. That's three times.\n\nThe plan is to iterate through the string, check at each index if the substring starts there, and increment the count if it does. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps. The length of the substring is important. If the substring is empty, maybe return 0? But the first example shows that when the main string is empty, it returns 0. Wait, but the parameters are string and substring. So if substring is empty, perhaps the function should return 0? But the problem says that the function is supposed to find how many times the substring can be found. However, in the examples, when the substring is 'a' and the string is empty, it returns 0. So perhaps the function should handle empty substrings as 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the function should count overlapping cases. So, for the general case:\n\nInitialize a count to 0.\n\nLoop through the string from index 0 to len(string) - len(substring), inclusive. Because if the substring is of length n, the last possible starting index is len(string) - n.\n\nFor each index i in this range, check if the substring starting at i is equal to the target substring. If yes, increment count.\n\nBut how to check that? For each i, check string[i:i + len(substring)] == substring. If yes, count +=1.\n\nYes. So, the code would be something like:\n\ncount = 0\nsub_len = len(substring)\nif sub_len == 0:\n    return 0\nfor i in range(len(string) - sub_len + 1):\n    if string[i:i+sub_len] == substring:\n        count +=1\nreturn count\n\nBut wait, what if the substring is empty? The first example has the first argument as empty string and returns 0. But in the function parameters, the substring is given. So, if the substring is empty, perhaps the function should return 0? Because in the examples, when the string is empty, it returns 0. But the problem says that the function should count how many times the substring can be found. However, in practice, an empty substring can be found infinitely many times, but the problem probably expects that if the substring is empty, return 0. Because the examples given don't have that case. But the first example is how_many_times('', 'a') returns 0. So, in that case, the substring is not empty, but the string is empty. So the code above would handle that, because len(substring) is 1, and len(string) is 0, so the loop doesn't run, count remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the substring is empty? For example, how_many_times('abc', '') would return 0 according to the code, but maybe the problem expects that? But the problem's examples don't cover this case. However, according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to count the number of times the substring can be found. However, in Python, the empty string is considered to be a substring of any string, and occurs infinitely many times, but the problem's examples don't include that. So, perhaps the function should return 0 if the substring is empty, as per the first example's logic. Because in the first example, the substring is 'a', and the string is empty, returns 0. So, if the substring is empty, perhaps the function should return 0 as well. So in the code, if the substring is empty, return 0. That's handled in the code above with the check if sub_len == 0: return 0.\n\nSo that's the code. Now, let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example: how_many_times('', 'a') returns 0. The code would check sub_len = 1, len(string) is 0. So, len(string) - sub_len +1 is 0 -1 +1 = 0. So the loop runs from 0 to -1, which is not executed. So count remains 0. Correct.\n\nSecond example: how_many_times('aaa', 'a') returns 3. The sub_len is 1. The loop runs from i=0 to 3-1=2 (since len('aaa') is 3). So i ranges from 0,1,2. Each time, string[i:i+1] is 'a', so count increments 3 times. Correct.\n\nThird example: how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa') returns 3. sub_len is 2. len(string) is 4. So the loop runs from i=0 to 4-2 = 2. So i=0,1,2. For i=0: 'aa' (positions 0-1) is 'aa' \u2192 count 1. i=1: positions 1-2 \u2192 'aa' \u2192 count 2. i=2: positions 2-3 \u2192 'aa' \u2192 count 3. So returns 3. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work. Now, implement that in Python.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncount = 0\nsub_len = len(substring)\nif sub_len == 0:\n    return 0\nfor i in range(len(string) - sub_len + 1):\n    if string[i:i+sub_len] == substring:\n        count +=1\nreturn count\n\nBut wait, what if the substring is longer than the string? For example, string is 'a', substring is 'aa'. Then, len(string) - sub_len +1 = 1-2 +1 = 0. So the loop doesn't run, count is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nSo the body of the function would be:\n\ncount = 0\nsub_len = len(substring)\nif sub_len == 0:\n    return 0\nfor i in range(len(string) - sub_len + 1):\n    if string[i:i+sub_len] == substring:\n        count += 1\nreturn count\n\nYes.

I need to write the body of the intersperse function. The function takes a list of integers and a delimiter, and inserts the delimiter between every two consecutive elements. \n\nFirst, I should think about edge cases. Like if the input list is empty, then return empty. Also, if there's only one element, then return just that element without any delimiter.\n\nSo, how to approach this? Maybe iterate through the numbers list, and for each element except the first, add the delimiter before it. Wait, no. Because between elements. For example, [1,2,3] becomes [1,4,2,4,3]. So between 1 and 2, insert 4. Between 2 and 3, insert 4. So the result has length 2n -1, where n is the original length.\n\nSo, the plan is: create a new list. Start by adding the first element. Then, for each subsequent element, add the delimiter followed by the element. But wait, that would add the delimiter before each element except the first. Let me check:\n\nOriginal list: [a, b, c]. The result should be [a, delimiter, b, delimiter, c]. So yes, for each element after the first, we add delimiter and then the element.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- If the numbers list is empty, return empty.\n- Otherwise, start with the first element.\n- Then, for each element in numbers[1:], append delimiter and then the element.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nresult = []\nif not numbers:\n    return []\nresult.append(numbers[0])\nfor num in numbers[1:]:\n    result.append(delimiter)\n    result.append(num)\nreturn result\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example: intersperse([],4) returns [], which is correct.\n\nSecond example: intersperse([1,2,3],4). The code would start with [1], then loop over 2 and 3. For 2: append 4 and 2. Then for 3: append 4 and 3. So the result is [1,4,2,4,3], which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: intersperse([5], 0) should return [5]. Which works because the loop doesn't run.\n\nAnother case: intersperse([1,2], 3) becomes [1,3,2]. Correct.\n\nSo this logic should work. Now, implement that in Python.\n\nSo the code inside the function would be:\n\nif not numbers:\n    return []\nresult = [numbers[0]]\nfor num in numbers[1:]:\n    result.append(delimiter)\n    result.append(num)\nreturn result\n\nYes, that's the code. Now, make sure to use the variables correctly. The parameters are 'numbers' and 'delimiter'. So yes, the code uses those variables.\n\nSo the body of the function is as written.\n</think>\n\nif not numbers:\n    return []\nresult = [numbers[0]]\nfor num in numbers[1:]:\n    result.append(delimiter)\n    result.append(num)\nreturn result", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": false, "reason": "not_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 219.21107411384583}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 468107}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838e0-f30a-7c57-b968-e09aec34bd79", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T20:02:03.146376Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 20, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction find_closest_elements d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

Let me think about the problem. The input is a string with groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. For each group, I have to find the maximum depth of nesting and return a list of those depths.\n\nFirst, I should split the input string into individual groups. Since they're separated by spaces, using split() would work. Then, for each group, process it to find the maximum depth.\n\nHow to calculate the depth? For each character in the group, track the current depth. Start at 0. When you see '(', increase the depth by 1. When you see ')', decrease it by 1. The maximum depth encountered during this process is the value for that group.\n\nSo, for each group in the split list:\n- Initialize current_depth and max_depth to 0.\n- Iterate over each character in the group.\n- For each '(': current_depth +=1, then check if it's larger than max_depth.\n- For each ')': current_depth -=1.\n- After processing the group, add max_depth to the result list.\n\nWait, but what about invalid cases? The problem probably assumes that the input is valid, as the examples don't mention error handling. So I don't need to handle mismatched parentheses.\n\nLet me test with the example: '(()())' should give 2. Let's simulate:\n- '(', current_depth 1, max 1.\n- '(', current_depth 2, max 2.\n- ')', current_depth 1.\n- '(', current_depth 2 again, but max is already 2.\n- ')', 1.\n- ')', 0. So the max is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: '((()))' goes to 3.\n\nSo the steps are clear.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nSplit the input string into groups. Then for each group, compute the max depth.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nThe function will process each group. Let's code:\n\ngroups = paren_string.split()\nresult = []\nfor group in groups:\n    current_depth = 0\n    max_depth = 0\n    for char in group:\n        if char == '(':\n            current_depth +=1\n            if current_depth > max_depth:\n                max_depth = current_depth\n        elif char == ')':\n            current_depth -=1\n    result.append(max_depth)\nreturn result\n\nWait, but what if a group is empty? According to the example, there's a group '()' which returns 1. So for empty string, maybe it's not part of the input. The problem says \"groups for nested parentheses\", so each group is non-empty and properly formed.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nInput: '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'\n\nSplitting into groups: ['(()())', '((()))', '()', '((())()())']\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFirst group: max depth 2.\n\nSecond group: 3.\n\nThird group: 1.\n\nFourth group: Let's see:\n\n'((())()())' \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- '(', 1, max 1\n- '(', 2, max 2\n- '(', 3, max 3\n- ')', 2\n- ')', 1\n- '(', 2, max still 3\n- ')', 1\n- '(', 2, max 3\n- ')', 1\n- ')', 0.\n\nSo max is 3.

The goal is to take a list of numbers and linearly transform them so that the smallest becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should find the minimum and maximum values in the input list. If all numbers are the same, then the max and min will be equal, which would cause division by zero. But the problem statement says the list has at least two elements, but maybe they could be the same? Wait, the example given has distinct numbers. However, the function needs to handle cases where min and max are the same. Oh, but if all elements are equal, then after transformation, all should be 0.0? Or maybe 0.0 and 1.0? Wait, no. If all numbers are the same, then the min and max are equal. So the formula (x - min)/(max - min) would be division by zero. So I need to handle that case. But the problem says \"given list of numbers (of at least two elements)\", but doesn't specify if they are distinct. So I need to account for that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"apply a linear transform to that list, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1\". If all numbers are the same, then the smallest and largest are the same. But in that case, how to rescale? Well, if all numbers are equal, then the transformed list should have all elements as 0.0? Because if you can't scale to 0 and 1, but the problem says \"smallest will become 0 and the largest will become 1\". If all elements are the same, then the min and max are the same. So, in this case, perhaps the function should return a list of zeros? Or maybe raise an error? But the problem's example doesn't cover that. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says that the input list has at least two elements, but nothing about them being distinct. So I need to handle that.\n\nBut in the example, the numbers are distinct. So perhaps the function is supposed to work when there are at least two elements, but if all are same, then the denominator is zero. So, in that case, perhaps we can return a list of zeros? Or maybe raise an error. However, the problem's example doesn't mention that, so perhaps the function is expected to handle that case by returning zeros.\n\nBut the problem says \"apply a linear transform such that the smallest becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1\". If all elements are the same, then the smallest and largest are the same. So, the linear transform would be (x - min)/(max - min) which is 0.0 / 0.0, which is undefined. So, in that case, perhaps the function should return a list of zeros? Or maybe the function can assume that the input has at least two distinct elements. However, the problem's initial statement says that the list has at least two elements, but not necessarily distinct. So, the function must handle that.\n\nHmm. Well, the problem's example doesn't have that case, so perhaps in the code, we can proceed under the assumption that the input list has at least two elements, and that the min and max are different. However, to avoid division by zero, perhaps the code should check if the max and min are equal. If they are, then return a list of zeros. Or perhaps return [0.0] * len(numbers), since if all numbers are the same, then they would all map to 0.0. But that's not correct according to the problem's specification, but perhaps that's the best we can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to work only when the list has at least two distinct elements. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. So, perhaps the code should proceed as follows:\n\nCompute min_val = min(numbers)\n\nmax_val = max(numbers)\n\nIf max_val == min_val, then return [0.0] * len(numbers), since (x - min)/(max - min) would be 0.0 / 0.0, which is undefined. But in this case, since all elements are same, they can be considered as 0.0 after scaling. But that's an assumption.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the input list has at least two distinct elements. However, the problem statement doesn't say that, so the code must handle the case where min and max are equal.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimum and maximum of the list.\n\n2. Check if the max and min are equal. If yes, return a list of zeros.\n\n3. Otherwise, for each number in the list, compute (x - min) / (max - min), and return the list of these values.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nmin_val = min(numbers)\n\nmax_val = max(numbers)\n\nif max_val == min_val:\n\n    return [0.0 for _ in numbers]\n\nelse:\n\n    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]\n\nBut in Python, list comprehensions can be used.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nmin_val = min(numbers)\n\nmax_val = max(numbers)\n\nif max_val == min_val:\n\n    return [0.0]*len(numbers)\n\nelse:\n\n    return [ (x - min_val)/(max_val - min_val) for x in numbers ]\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the input is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], which has min 1.0, max 5.0. So for each x, (x-1)/(5-1) = (x-1)/4. For 1, (1-1)/4 = 0. For 2: 1/4 = 0.25, etc. Which matches the example.\n\nSo that code should work. Now, the function is supposed to return a list of floats. So in the case where all elements are same, return list of 0.0s.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input list has at least two elements, but if they are same, the code returns all zeros.\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nNow, implementing that in Python.\n\nThe code inside the function would be:\n\nmin_val = min(numbers)\n\nmax_val = max(numbers)\n\nif max_val == min_val:\n\n    return [0.0]*len(numbers)\n\nelse:\n\n    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]\n\nBut in Python, the list comprehension can be written as such.\n\nSo that's the code.\n</think>\n\n```python\nmin_val = min(numbers)\nmax_val = max(numbers)\nif max_val == min_val:\n    return [0.0] * len(numbers)\nelse:\n    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]\n```", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": false, "reason": "not_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 229.79830384254456}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 452095}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d69-79e0-85a4-a1fa0c9ee113", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.865425Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 12, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction longest d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.

Let's see. The function takes a list of strings and returns the longest one. If there are multiple with the same length, return the first one. And if the list is empty, return None.\n\nFirst, check if the input list is empty. If it is, return None. That's straightforward.\n\nIf the list isn't empty, I need to find the longest string. How to do that? Maybe iterate through the list and keep track of the longest length found so far and the corresponding string.\n\nInitialize variables: max_length to 0 and max_string to None. Then loop through each string in the list. For each string, check its length. If it's longer than max_length, update max_length and max_string. If it's equal to max_length, do nothing because we want the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but the first occurrence is the one that should be kept. So during iteration, if a string has the same length as the current max, we don't replace it. That way, the first one remains.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check if the list is empty. If yes, return None.\n- Otherwise, initialize max_length and max_string.\n- Iterate over each string in the list:\n   - If the length of the current string is greater than max_length, update max_length and max_string.\n- After processing all strings, return max_string.\n\nWait, but what about the case when the list has one element? Then the max_string would be that element.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: longest([]) returns None. Correct.\n\nSample 2: ['a', 'b', 'c'] all have length 1. The first one is 'a', so return 'a'.\n\nSample 3: ['a', 'bb', 'ccc'] has 'ccc' as the longest, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCheck if not strings: return None.\n\nElse, initialize max_len to 0 and max_str to None.\n\nThen for s in strings:\n\n   if len(s) > max_len:\n\n       max_len = len(s)\n\n       max_str = s\n\nThen return max_str.\n\nWait, but what if all strings are empty? Like ['','','']? Then the first one is returned, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: strings with varying lengths. The code should pick the longest, and first if same length.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nif not strings:\n\n    return None\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nmax_str = None\n\nfor s in strings:\n\n    if len(s) > max_len:\n\n        max_len = len(s)\n\n        max_str = s\n\nreturn max_str\n\nBut wait, what if the list is not empty but all strings are empty? Like ['','',''], then the first one is returned, which is correct.\n\nYes. And in the case where the list has one element, it's handled.\n\nSo that's the logic. Now, translate that into code.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ndef longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:\n\n    if not strings:\n\n        return None\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    max_str = None\n\n    for s in strings:\n\n        if len(s) > max_len:\n\n            max_len = len(s)\n\n            max_str = s\n\n    return max_str\n\nWait, but what if all strings are empty? Then max_len remains 0, and max_str is None. But the list is not empty, so the code returns None. But that's incorrect. Because if the list is not empty, even if all strings are empty, the first one should be returned.\n\nWait, no. Because in that case, the first string is empty. So the code's initial max_len is 0, and the first string's length is 0. So the condition len(s) > max_len is false. So max_str remains None. But that's wrong. Because the list is not empty, but the code returns None.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because if the list is not empty, but all strings are empty, then the code returns None, but according to the problem statement, the function should return the first one in case of same length. So in this case, the first string (which is empty) should be returned.\n\nBut in the code above, when the first string is processed, len(s) is 0, which is equal to max_len (which is initialized to 0). So the condition len(s) > max_len is false, so max_str remains None. Then, after the loop, return max_str, which is None. But that's wrong. Because the list is not empty, but the code returns None.\n\nSo there's a mistake here. The initial value of max_len is 0, but if the first string is empty, then len(s) is 0. So the code doesn't update max_str. But the function should return the first string even if it's empty.\n\nAh, right. So the problem is with the initial value of max_len. Because when the first string is empty, the code doesn't set max_str to that string. So how to fix that?\n\nWe need to initialize max_len to -infinity or something, but in Python, maybe we can set it to -1, and then for each string, compare. Alternatively, we can set max_str to the first string, and then start the loop from the second element.\n\nWait, but that's more complicated. Let's think.\n\nAlternative approach: if the list is not empty, the first string is the initial candidate. Then, iterate from the second element onwards.\n\nSo:\n\nif not strings:\n\n    return None\n\nmax_str = strings[0]\n\nmax_len = len(strings[0])\n\nfor s in strings[1:]:\n\n    if len(s) > max_len:\n\n        max_len = len(s)\n\n        max_str = s\n\nreturn max_str\n\nThis way, even if all strings are empty, the first one is selected.\n\nYes. That would handle the case where all strings are empty. Because the first string is set as max_str, and then the loop checks the rest. If all are empty, the loop doesn't change max_str, so it returns the first one.\n\nSo the original code had a bug in the initial setup. The initial max_len is 0, but if the first string is empty (len 0), then the code doesn't set max_str. So the code would return None in that case. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct approach is to initialize max_str to the first element and max_len to its length, and then loop through the rest.\n\nSo that's the correct way.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif not strings:\n\n    return None\n\nmax_str = strings[0]\n\nmax_len = len(strings[0])\n\nfor s in strings[1:]:\n\n    if len(s) > max_len:\n\n        max_len = len(s)\n\n        max_str = s\n\nreturn max_str\n\nThis way, even if all strings are empty, the first one is selected.\n\nTesting this:\n\nCase 1: strings is empty \u2192 return None. Correct.\n\nCase 2: ['a', 'b', 'c'] \u2192 first is 'a', len 1. The rest have len 1, so no change. return 'a'. Correct.\n\nCase 3: ['a', 'bb', 'ccc'] \u2192 first is 'a', len 1. Then 'bb' is 2>1 \u2192 update. Then 'ccc' is 3>2 \u2192 update. return 'ccc'. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: ['','',''] \u2192 first is '', len 0. The rest are same. So return first.\n\nAnother test case: ['a', '', 'a'] \u2192 first is 'a' (len 1). Then '' (0 < 1 \u2192 no change). Then 'a' (len 1, same as max_len \u2192 no change. So return 'a'.\n\nAnother case: ['a', 'aa', 'a'] \u2192 first is 'a', len 1. Then 'aa' (2>1 \u2192 update. Then 'a' (1 < 2 \u2192 no change. return 'aa'.\n\nYes. So that code is correct.\n\nSo the body of the function should be:\n\nif not strings:\n\n    return None\n\nmax_str = strings[0]\n\nmax_len = len(strings[0])\n\nfor s in strings[1:]:\n\n    if len(s) > max_len:\n\n        max_len = len(s)\n\n        max_str = s\n\nreturn max_str\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code would have to handle the case where the list is empty.

Oh right, in the algorithm, we take the absolute values and swap them if necessary. But since the inputs are integers, maybe I should ensure that the function works even if a or b is negative. However, the GCD is always a positive integer, so I should take the absolute values first.\n\nSo the steps would be: take the absolute values of a and b. Then, while b is not zero, replace a with b and b with a mod b. When b is zero, a is the GCD.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given. For 3 and 5: absolute values are 3 and 5. Then, 5 mod 3 is 2. Now a is 3, b is 2. Then 3 mod 2 is 1. Now a is 2, b is 1. Then 2 mod 1 is 0. Now a is 1, b is 0. So return 1. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: 25 and 15. Absolute values 25 and 15. 25 mod 15 is 10. Now a=15, b=10. 15 mod 10 is 5. Now a=10, b=5. 10 mod 5 is 0. Now a=5, b=0. Return 5. Correct.\n\nSo the code should start by taking absolute values. Then apply the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nImplementing this in Python: the function takes a and b. First, take absolute values. Then, while b != 0: a, b = b, a % b. Then return a.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results if the dividend is negative. But since we take absolute values first, a and b are positive. So the modulo operation should work correctly.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\na = abs(a)\nb = abs(b)\nwhile b != 0:\n    a, b = b, a % b\nreturn a\n\nYes. That should handle all cases. Let me check edge cases. What if one of the numbers is zero? For example, GCD(0, 5) should be 5. Let's see: a becomes 0, b becomes 5. Then in the loop, since b is not zero, a becomes 5, b becomes 0%5 which is 0. Then loop ends, return 5. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: both zero. But the function would return 0, but mathematically GCD(0,0) is undefined. However, the problem statement says the function returns an int. But in the examples, the inputs are non-zero. The problem says the function is for two integers. But the code will handle that case as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, write this in the function body.\n</think>\n\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a", "scores": {"score_function": {"exact_match": false, "reason": "not_equivalent"}}, "model_latency": 44.897573709487915}, "summary": {"status_counts": {"success": 5, "error": 0}, "weave": {"status": "success", "trace_name": "Evaluation.predict_and_score", "latency_ms": 408652}}, "wb_user_id": "VXNlcjoyNzEzNTg1", "wb_run_id": null, "wb_run_step": null, "deleted_at": null, "storage_size_bytes": null, "total_storage_size_bytes": null},{"id": "019838de-6d6e-716e-9151-3e5389945507", "project_id": "laurentvv-none/simple_bench", "op_name": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/op/Evaluation.predict_and_score:nLHkt0g39v37SSRn7yuZglKjboXicyHRcwrGBixaQio", "display_name": null, "trace_id": "019838de-6d50-7146-978e-5a860d05d284", "parent_id": "019838de-6d51-7c9c-ae8a-d4d9a71bd762", "thread_id": null, "turn_id": null, "started_at": "2025-07-23T19:59:17.870899Z", "attributes": {"weave": {"python": {"type": "async_function"}, "client_version": "0.51.56", "source": "python-sdk", "sys_version": "3.13.5 (tags/v3.13.5:6cb20a2, Jun 11 2025, 16:15:46) [MSC v.1943 64 bit (AMD64)]", "os_name": "Windows", "os_version": "10.0.26100", "os_release": "11"}}, "inputs": {"self": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/Evaluation:8pZNPPL88nKu4vBACTYjhuod84IuHXJRPtWvnr6st5Q", "model": "weave:///laurentvv-none/simple_bench/object/LiteLLMModel:RgDtGqSWuzGWKXmBrR9EL88lHijJzoQLf311zEY8Fc0", "example": {"question_id": 17, "prompt": "D\u00e9finissez le corps de la fonction parse_music d\u00e9crite ci-dessous.
